NPM package to find lyrics to any given song.

Although the code is not licensed, the lyrics are highly likely to be licensed by the respective record label.

I take no responsibility for the actions used with the code.

## How is it done?
It scrapes Genius to find the lyrics.

If the scraper fails on Genius, it falls back to MusixMatch.

## Sample Code

This code gets the lyrics of ``I Just Wanna Shine`` by ``Fitz and The Tantrums``.

```js
const ftl = require("findthelyrics");

var artist = "Fitz and The Tantrums";
var title = "I Just Wanna Shine";

ftl.find(artist, title, function(err, resp) {
    if (!err) {
        console.log(resp)
    } else {
        console.log(err)
    }
    // [Chorus]
    // I just wanna shine like the sun when it comes up
    // Run the city from the rooftops
    // 'Cause todayâ€™s gonna be my day
    // I just wanna climb to the top of a mountain
    // Standing tall when I'm howlin'
    // ...
})
```
